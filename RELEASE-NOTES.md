RELEASE NOTES
=============

Version: 0.2
------------
  Get EUID working correctly (basically fstat on /proc/PID/ directory is
  reliable while entries under /proc/PID/ are not).

  Now compiles and seems to work with --gc:arc (I could not break it, anyway).

  On my machine, compiled with gcc-10-PGO and `--gc:arc`, Nim `pd -d 0.00001`
  is now 775 samples per second compared to the C `top -ib -d0` 725/s.  I.e.
  Nim is 1.07x faster than C tuned for decades by performance sensitive `top`
  watchers.  It is true that `top -b -d0` lseek()s & re-parses a few system-
  wide files every sample (/proc/loadavg, /proc/stat, /proc/uptime), this is
  in addition to literally 320 /proc/PID files and so unlikely to fully explain
  the difference.  I suspect the way top is reading /var/run/utmp very, very
  carefully with several times over reset alarm(2) calls.  Regardless, it's
  probably fair to say performance parity with C is basically achieved now.
